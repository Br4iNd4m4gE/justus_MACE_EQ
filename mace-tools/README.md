Add on package that sits on top of [MACE](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace) and implements a bunch of approaches to treating long range electrostatics


Depends on Will's [graph_longrange](https://github.com/WillBaldwin0/graph_longrange) to handle evaluation of electrostatics with either real or reciprocal space calculation, depending on the periodicity of the system
